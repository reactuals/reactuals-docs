<BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {() => <UseTextSelectionExample />}
</BrowserOnly>

### Usage

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useTextSelection } from "reactuals";

function TextSelection() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const { text } = useTextSelection(ref);

  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 600, marginBottom: 10 }}>
        <span role="img" aria-label="cursor">
          üñ±Ô∏è
        </span>{" "}
        Select any part of this text!
      </p>

        The ocean covers 70% of the Earth's surface and is home to a vast array
        of life forms. Oceans regulate the planet's climate, absorb carbon
        dioxide, and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people.
        Beneath the waves lies a world of incredible diversity, from the
        smallest plankton to the largest whales. Coral reefs, often called the
        "rainforests of the sea," support more species per unit area than any
        other marine environment. However, human activities such as overfishing,
        pollution, and climate change threaten the delicate balance of ocean
        ecosystems. Protecting our oceans is essential for maintaining
        biodiversity and ensuring a healthy planet for future generations.

      {text && <p className="mt-4 text-blue-600">Selected: {text}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
